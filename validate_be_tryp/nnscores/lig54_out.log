When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
6.439 = 363.95 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
-0.294 +/- 2.245 = 1.97 M). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.97 M
