When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
12.4 = 398.37 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.793 +/- 3.328 = 1.61 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.61 uM
