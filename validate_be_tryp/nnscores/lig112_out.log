When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
14.353 = 4.44 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.771 +/- 3.501 = 1.69 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.69 uM
