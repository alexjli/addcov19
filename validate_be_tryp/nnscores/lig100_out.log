When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
12.413 = 386.29 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.605 +/- 3.196 = 2.48 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.48 uM
