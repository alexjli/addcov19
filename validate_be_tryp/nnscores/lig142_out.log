When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
7.4 = 39.78 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
-0.205 +/- 2.469 = 1.6 M). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.6 M
