Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 7.729 = 18.65 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
8.958 = 1.1 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
4.411 +/- 2.327 = 38.83 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

38.83 uM
