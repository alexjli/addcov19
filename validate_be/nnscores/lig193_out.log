Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 6.927 = 118.24 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.111 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
5.179 +/- 3.694 = 6.62 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

6.62 uM
