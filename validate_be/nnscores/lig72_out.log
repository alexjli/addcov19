Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 6.418 = 382.29 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
16.953 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
3.885 +/- 3.592 = 130.35 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

130.35 uM
