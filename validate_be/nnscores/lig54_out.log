Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 5.227 = 5.93 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
10.526 = 29.79 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
6.42 +/- 2.764 = 380.36 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

380.36 nM
