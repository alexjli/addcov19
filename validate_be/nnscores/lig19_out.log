Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 9.58 = 262.82 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
18.361 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.961 +/- 3.254 = 10.95 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

10.95 nM
