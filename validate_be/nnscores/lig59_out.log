Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 10.518 = 30.37 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
10.518 = 30.37 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
6.775 +/- 1.552 = 167.97 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

167.97 nM
