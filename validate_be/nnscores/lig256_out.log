Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 6.933 = 116.76 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
7.537 = 29.05 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.486 +/- 2.449 = 32.65 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

32.65 uM
