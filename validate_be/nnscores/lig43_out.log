Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 6.347 = 449.64 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
7.797 = 15.97 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
4.558 +/- 1.161 = 27.69 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

27.69 uM
