Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 9 (Score = 7.828 = 14.84 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 5.823 = 1.5 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
17.203 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
6.749 +/- 4.341 = 178.41 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

178.41 nM
