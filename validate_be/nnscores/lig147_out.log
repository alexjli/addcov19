Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 6.267 = 540.66 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
17.255 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
7.454 +/- 2.255 = 35.18 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

35.18 nM
