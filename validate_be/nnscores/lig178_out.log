Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 8.259 = 5.51 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
14.45 = 3.54 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
3.42 +/- 2.662 = 380.11 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

380.11 uM
