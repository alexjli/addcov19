Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 8 (Score = 5.162 = 6.88 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 5.829 = 1.48 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.405 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
4.666 +/- 1.767 = 21.58 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

21.58 uM
