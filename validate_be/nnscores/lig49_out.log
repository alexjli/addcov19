Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 10.267 = 54.06 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
10.267 = 54.06 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
5.375 +/- 1.775 = 4.21 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

4.21 uM
