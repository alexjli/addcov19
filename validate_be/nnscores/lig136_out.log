Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 8.336 = 4.62 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
15.344 = 0.45 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
6.026 +/- 4.121 = 941.77 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

941.77 nM
