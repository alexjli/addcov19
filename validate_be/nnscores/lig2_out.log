Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 7.304 = 49.7 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
9.594 = 254.74 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
4.464 +/- 2.093 = 34.34 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

34.34 uM
