Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 9.455 = 350.83 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
17.086 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
5.035 +/- 2.588 = 9.22 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

9.22 uM
