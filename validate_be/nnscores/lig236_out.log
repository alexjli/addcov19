Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 6.19 = 645.97 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
7.957 = 11.04 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
4.947 +/- 1.792 = 11.3 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

11.3 uM
