Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 10.355 = 44.14 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
3.72 +/- 2.193 = 190.7 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

190.7 uM
