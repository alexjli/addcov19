Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 11.978 = 1.05 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
12.496 = 319.25 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
5.347 +/- 2.618 = 4.49 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

4.49 uM
