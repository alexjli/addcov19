Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 5.897 = 1.27 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
7.062 = 86.67 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
2.961 +/- 2.008 = 1.09 mM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.09 mM
