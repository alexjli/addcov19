Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 6.138 = 727.13 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
10.076 = 83.85 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
3.252 +/- 2.09 = 559.64 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

559.64 uM
