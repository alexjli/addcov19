Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 13.542 = 28.69 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
16.221 = 0.06 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
8.318 +/- 3.454 = 4.8 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

4.8 nM
