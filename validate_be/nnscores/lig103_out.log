Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 7.071 = 84.99 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.301 = 50.04 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
3.649 +/- 1.863 = 224.27 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

224.27 uM
