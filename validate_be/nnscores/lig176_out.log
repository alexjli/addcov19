Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 9.044 = 904.23 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
9.044 = 904.23 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
3.003 +/- 2.478 = 992.3 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

992.3 uM
