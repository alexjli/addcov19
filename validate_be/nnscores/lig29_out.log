Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 10.728 = 18.7 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
18.483 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.418 +/- 2.704 = 38.22 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

38.22 uM
