Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 6.581 = 262.3 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
9.336 = 461.3 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
6.208 +/- 2.297 = 619.7 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

619.7 nM
