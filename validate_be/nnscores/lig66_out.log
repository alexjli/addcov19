Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 7.925 = 11.89 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
9.774 = 168.16 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
5.022 +/- 2.114 = 9.51 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

9.51 uM
