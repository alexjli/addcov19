Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 9.707 = 196.31 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
18.191 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
6.932 +/- 5.107 = 117.08 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

117.08 nM
