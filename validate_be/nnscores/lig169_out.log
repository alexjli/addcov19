Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 6.928 = 117.98 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
7.805 = 15.67 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
4.712 +/- 1.986 = 19.42 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

19.42 uM
