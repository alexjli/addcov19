Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 6.755 = 175.88 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
8.283 = 5.22 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.076 +/- 2.073 = 8.39 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

8.39 uM
