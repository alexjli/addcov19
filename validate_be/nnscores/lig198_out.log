Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 10.597 = 25.3 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
10.597 = 25.3 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
3.981 +/- 2.217 = 104.48 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

104.48 uM
