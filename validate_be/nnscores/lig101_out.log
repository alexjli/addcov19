Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 8.276 = 5.3 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
3.509 +/- 2.159 = 309.64 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

309.64 uM
