Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 11.202 = 6.28 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
14.88 = 1.32 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
4.916 +/- 3.493 = 12.13 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

12.13 uM
