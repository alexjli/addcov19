Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 5.535 = 2.92 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
16.972 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
4.141 +/- 2.504 = 72.34 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

72.34 uM
