Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 12.289 = 514.02 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
18.475 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
8.89 +/- 4.631 = 1.29 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.29 nM
