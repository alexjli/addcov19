Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 8.619 = 2.4 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
12.9 = 125.96 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
4.247 +/- 2.213 = 56.57 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

56.57 uM
