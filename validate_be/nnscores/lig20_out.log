Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 7.341 = 45.61 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
14.397 = 4.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
6.658 +/- 3.455 = 219.81 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

219.81 nM
