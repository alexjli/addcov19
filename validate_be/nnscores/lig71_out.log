Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 4 (Score = 6.332 = 465.1 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.587 = 2.59 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
8.95 = 1.12 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
2.472 +/- 2.788 = 3.38 mM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

3.38 mM
