Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 10.377 = 42.02 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
10.377 = 42.02 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.698 +/- 2.653 = 200.38 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

200.38 uM
