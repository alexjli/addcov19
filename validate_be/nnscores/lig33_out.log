Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.142 = 7.22 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 8.83 = 1.48 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.478 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
7.616 +/- 5.481 = 24.21 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

24.21 nM
