Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 11.875 = 1.33 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
17.703 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.871 +/- 4.532 = 13.46 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

13.46 uM
