Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 11.094 = 8.05 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
16.465 = 0.03 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.283 +/- 3.958 = 5.22 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

5.22 uM
