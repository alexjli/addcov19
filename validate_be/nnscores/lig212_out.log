Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 6.494 = 320.82 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
13.982 = 10.42 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
4.696 +/- 3.665 = 20.13 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

20.13 uM
