Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 5.792 = 1.61 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
13.226 = 59.41 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
7.07 +/- 3.689 = 85.21 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

85.21 nM
