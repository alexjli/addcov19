Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 9.971 = 107.01 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
11.638 = 2.3 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.453 +/- 2.283 = 35.21 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

35.21 uM
