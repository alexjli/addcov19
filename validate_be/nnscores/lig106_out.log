Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.073 = 8.45 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
13.158 = 69.52 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
5.911 +/- 1.895 = 1.23 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.23 uM
