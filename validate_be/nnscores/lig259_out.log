Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 6.976 = 105.58 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
13.655 = 22.13 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
5.642 +/- 2.624 = 2.28 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.28 uM
