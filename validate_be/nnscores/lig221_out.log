Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 2 (Score = 5.789 = 1.62 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 7.477 = 33.34 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.533 = 29.34 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
4.11 +/- 1.705 = 77.64 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

77.64 uM
