Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 12.147 = 713.48 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.172 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
7.154 +/- 4.174 = 70.2 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

70.2 nM
