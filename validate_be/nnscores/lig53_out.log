Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 3 (Score = 8.026 = 9.42 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 7.963 = 10.89 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.473 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
6.178 +/- 3.816 = 664.26 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

664.26 nM
