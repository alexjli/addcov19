Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 5.563 = 2.74 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
15.211 = 0.61 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.295 +/- 4.338 = 50.74 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

50.74 uM
