Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 8.515 = 3.06 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
17.434 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
6.728 +/- 2.768 = 186.86 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

186.86 nM
