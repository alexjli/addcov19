Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 12.066 = 858.2 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
12.066 = 858.2 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
6.185 +/- 2.375 = 653.82 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

653.82 nM
