Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 8.471 = 3.38 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
6.727 +/- 3.58 = 187.43 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

187.43 nM
