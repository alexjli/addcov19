Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 6.799 = 158.68 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
7.701 = 19.92 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
3.767 +/- 2.195 = 171.09 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

171.09 uM
