Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 7.757 = 17.5 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
15.839 = 0.14 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
5.59 +/- 2.833 = 2.57 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.57 uM
