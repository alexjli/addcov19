Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 7.088 = 81.7 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
10.54 = 28.82 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
6.457 +/- 2.949 = 349.17 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

349.17 nM
