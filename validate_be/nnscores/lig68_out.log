Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 5.909 = 1.23 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
7.956 = 11.07 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
4.625 +/- 1.522 = 23.7 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

23.7 uM
