Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.205 = 62.43 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
8.838 = 1.45 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.551 +/- 1.811 = 28.12 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

28.12 uM
