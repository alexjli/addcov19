Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 7.749 = 17.81 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
8.125 = 7.5 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
5.042 +/- 1.716 = 9.08 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

9.08 uM
