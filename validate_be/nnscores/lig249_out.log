Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 11.73 = 1.86 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.897 +/- 6.31 = 12.66 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

12.66 nM
