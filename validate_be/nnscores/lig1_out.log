Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 6.686 = 206.19 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
14.151 = 7.06 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
4.582 +/- 3.55 = 26.19 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

26.19 uM
