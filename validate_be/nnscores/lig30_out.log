Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 9.938 = 115.4 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
18.451 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
6.584 +/- 2.51 = 260.64 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

260.64 nM
