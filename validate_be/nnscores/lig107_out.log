Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 9.733 = 184.86 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.482 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
8.009 +/- 3.94 = 9.79 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

9.79 nM
