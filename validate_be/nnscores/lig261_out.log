Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 5.606 = 2.48 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
8.356 = 4.41 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
5.035 +/- 2.144 = 9.23 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

9.23 uM
