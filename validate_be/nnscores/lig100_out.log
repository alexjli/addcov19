Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 9 (Score = 8.14 = 7.24 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 8.142 = 7.21 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.483 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
8.294 +/- 3.684 = 5.08 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

5.08 nM
