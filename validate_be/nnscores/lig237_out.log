Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 8 (Score = 7.064 = 86.25 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 9.551 = 281.4 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
9.551 = 281.4 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
6.476 +/- 1.817 = 334.51 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

334.51 nM
