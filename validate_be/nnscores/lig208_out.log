Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 7 (Score = 8.142 = 7.21 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 7.459 = 34.78 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
8.526 +/- 4.924 = 2.98 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.98 nM
