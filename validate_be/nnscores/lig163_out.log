Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 11.919 = 1.21 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
9.957 +/- 4.778 = 110.47 pM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

110.47 pM
