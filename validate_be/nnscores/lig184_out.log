Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 11.211 = 6.16 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
8.473 +/- 5.618 = 3.37 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

3.37 nM
