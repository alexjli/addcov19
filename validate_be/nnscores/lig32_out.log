Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 6.624 = 237.72 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
6.845 = 142.97 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.743 +/- 1.281 = 180.86 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

180.86 uM
