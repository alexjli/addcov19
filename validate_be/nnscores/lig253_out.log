Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 11.669 = 2.14 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.458 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.117 +/- 3.242 = 76.36 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

76.36 nM
