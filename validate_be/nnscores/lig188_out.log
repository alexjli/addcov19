Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 5.054 = 8.82 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
9.89 = 128.89 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.804 +/- 1.947 = 15.7 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

15.7 uM
