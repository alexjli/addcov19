Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 7.982 = 10.43 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
7.994 = 10.14 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.667 +/- 2.116 = 21.54 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

21.54 uM
