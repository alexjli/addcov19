Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 8.931 = 1.17 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
17.747 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
8.628 +/- 2.926 = 2.35 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.35 nM
