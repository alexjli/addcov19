Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 9.606 = 248.02 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.132 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
7.25 +/- 3.186 = 56.19 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

56.19 nM
