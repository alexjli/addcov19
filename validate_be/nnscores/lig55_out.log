Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 5.233 = 5.85 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
7.68 = 20.89 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
4.291 +/- 1.898 = 51.12 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

51.12 uM
