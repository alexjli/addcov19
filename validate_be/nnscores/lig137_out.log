Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 6.002 = 995.24 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
7.239 = 57.62 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
3.224 +/- 1.705 = 597.02 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

597.02 uM
