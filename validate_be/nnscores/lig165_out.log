Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 8.895 = 1.27 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
16.313 = 0.05 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
6.313 +/- 3.656 = 486.08 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

486.08 nM
