Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 9.381 = 415.53 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
9.381 = 415.53 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
6.353 +/- 1.239 = 443.33 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

443.33 nM
