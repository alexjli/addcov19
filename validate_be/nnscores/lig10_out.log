Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 6.43 = 371.95 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
11.988 = 1.03 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
5.309 +/- 2.421 = 4.91 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

4.91 uM
