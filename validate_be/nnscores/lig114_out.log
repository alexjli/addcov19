Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 8.665 = 2.16 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
7.743 +/- 4.664 = 18.07 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

18.07 nM
