Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 6.45 = 354.98 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
18.301 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
7.547 +/- 3.956 = 28.38 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

28.38 nM
