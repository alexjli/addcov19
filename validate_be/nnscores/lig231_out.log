Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 7.719 = 19.11 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
18.483 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
7.573 +/- 6.064 = 26.76 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

26.76 nM
