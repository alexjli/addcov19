Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 4.553 = 27.96 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
8.112 = 7.73 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
2.85 +/- 1.845 = 1.41 mM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.41 mM
