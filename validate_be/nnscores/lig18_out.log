Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 4.683 = 20.77 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
9.651 = 223.57 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.982 +/- 1.82 = 104.17 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

104.17 uM
