Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 8.114 = 7.69 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
16.546 = 0.03 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.491 +/- 2.494 = 32.27 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

32.27 nM
