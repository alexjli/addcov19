Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 5 (Score = 8.117 = 7.64 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 7.441 = 36.22 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
17.315 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
8.124 +/- 4.105 = 7.52 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

7.52 nM
