Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 10.187 = 65.02 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
18.483 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
8.406 +/- 5.841 = 3.93 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

3.93 nM
