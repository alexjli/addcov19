Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.497 = 3.18 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
9.105 = 785.02 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.887 +/- 1.977 = 12.98 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

12.98 uM
