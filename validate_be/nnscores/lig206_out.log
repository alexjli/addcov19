Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 5.92 = 1.2 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.461 +/- 3.535 = 34.56 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

34.56 nM
