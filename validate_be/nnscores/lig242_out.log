Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 6.676 = 211.07 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
8.299 +/- 3.265 = 5.03 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

5.03 nM
