Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 8.938 = 1.15 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.481 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
8.161 +/- 4.157 = 6.9 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

6.9 nM
