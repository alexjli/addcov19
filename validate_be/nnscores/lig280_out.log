Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 5 (Score = 5.591 = 2.56 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 5.71 = 1.95 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
9.784 = 164.41 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.77 +/- 1.629 = 16.98 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

16.98 uM
