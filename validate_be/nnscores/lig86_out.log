Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 7 (Score = 8.143 = 7.2 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 6.778 = 166.82 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
8.033 +/- 6.412 = 9.26 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

9.26 nM
