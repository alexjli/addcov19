Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 5 (Score = 5.942 = 1.14 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 8.426 = 3.75 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
10.642 = 22.78 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
4.912 +/- 1.925 = 12.24 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

12.24 uM
