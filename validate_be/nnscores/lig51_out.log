Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 9 (Score = 7.85 = 14.12 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 6.222 = 599.86 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
17.044 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
6.991 +/- 5.036 = 102.04 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

102.04 nM
