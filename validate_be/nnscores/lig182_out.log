Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 4.699 = 19.99 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
7.399 = 39.94 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.738 +/- 1.632 = 182.89 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

182.89 uM
