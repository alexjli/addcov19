Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 8.878 = 1.33 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
9.867 = 135.85 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
4.387 +/- 2.537 = 40.99 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

40.99 uM
