Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 10.049 = 89.36 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
10.049 = 89.36 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
5.124 +/- 2.64 = 7.51 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

7.51 uM
