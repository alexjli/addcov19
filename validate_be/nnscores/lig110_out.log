Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 8.239 = 5.76 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
8.239 = 5.76 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
4.848 +/- 1.61 = 14.19 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

14.19 uM
