Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 6.376 = 420.45 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
7.331 = 46.7 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.052 +/- 1.232 = 88.72 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

88.72 uM
