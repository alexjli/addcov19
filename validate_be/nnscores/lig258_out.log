Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 7.095 = 80.33 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
8.719 = 1.91 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
4.606 +/- 2.508 = 24.76 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

24.76 uM
