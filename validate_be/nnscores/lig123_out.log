Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 8.633 = 2.33 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
10.349 = 44.79 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
5.299 +/- 2.932 = 5.03 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

5.03 uM
