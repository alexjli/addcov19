Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 7.804 = 15.69 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
9.831 = 147.59 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.077 +/- 2.66 = 83.77 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

83.77 uM
