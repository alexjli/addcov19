Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 7.606 = 24.8 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.478 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
6.673 +/- 2.946 = 212.51 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

212.51 nM
