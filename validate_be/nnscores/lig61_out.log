Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 6.422 = 378.26 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.136 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
6.899 +/- 3.978 = 126.14 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

126.14 nM
