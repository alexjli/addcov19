Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 10.062 = 86.65 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
17.396 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
4.695 +/- 3.016 = 20.17 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

20.17 uM
