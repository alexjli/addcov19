Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 9.523 = 299.99 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
9.523 = 299.99 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
3.874 +/- 1.844 = 133.73 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

133.73 uM
