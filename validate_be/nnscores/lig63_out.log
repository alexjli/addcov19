Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 11.694 = 2.02 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.466 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.062 +/- 3.797 = 86.69 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

86.69 nM
