Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 10.386 = 41.15 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.481 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
7.592 +/- 3.108 = 25.56 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

25.56 nM
