Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 2 (Score = 5.702 = 1.99 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 8.453 = 3.52 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
8.453 = 3.52 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.96 +/- 2.005 = 10.97 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

10.97 uM
