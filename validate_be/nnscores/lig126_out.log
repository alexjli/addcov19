Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.107 = 78.09 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.107 = 78.09 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
3.897 +/- 1.803 = 126.84 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

126.84 uM
