Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 12.596 = 253.74 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
8.779 +/- 5.693 = 1.66 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.66 nM
