Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 2 (Score = 7.715 = 19.27 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 8.28 = 5.25 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
16.566 = 0.03 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
6.77 +/- 3.449 = 169.94 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

169.94 nM
