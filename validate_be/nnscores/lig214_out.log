Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 4 (Score = 8.882 = 1.31 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 7.956 = 11.06 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
10.282 = 52.24 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
5.116 +/- 1.598 = 7.66 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

7.66 uM
