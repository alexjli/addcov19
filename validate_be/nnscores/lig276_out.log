Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 6.756 = 175.49 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
9.291 = 511.1 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
5.374 +/- 2.145 = 4.23 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

4.23 uM
