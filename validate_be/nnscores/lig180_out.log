Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 6.116 = 766.44 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
11.735 = 1.84 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
5.392 +/- 2.526 = 4.05 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

4.05 uM
