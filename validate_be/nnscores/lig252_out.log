Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 6.831 = 147.48 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
14.154 = 7.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.803 +/- 2.81 = 1.58 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.58 uM
