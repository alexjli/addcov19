Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 6.034 = 923.69 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
9.954 = 111.17 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
5.049 +/- 2.031 = 8.94 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

8.94 uM
