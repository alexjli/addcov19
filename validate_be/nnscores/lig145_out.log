Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 14.097 = 7.99 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
9.141 +/- 3.597 = 722.63 pM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.
