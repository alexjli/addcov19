Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 5.628 = 2.36 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
9.069 = 852.65 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
3.139 +/- 1.578 = 726.53 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.
