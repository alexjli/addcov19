Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 10.42 = 38.04 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
18.476 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
7.533 +/- 2.755 = 29.29 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

29.29 nM
