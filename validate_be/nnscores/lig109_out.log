Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 5.118 = 7.61 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
8.944 = 1.14 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.368 +/- 2.019 = 428.67 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

428.67 uM
