Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.076 = 8.39 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
8.485 = 3.27 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
3.816 +/- 2.285 = 152.75 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

152.75 uM
