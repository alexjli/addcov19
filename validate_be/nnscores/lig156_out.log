Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 10.946 = 11.31 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
10.946 = 11.31 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
5.556 +/- 3.121 = 2.78 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.78 uM
