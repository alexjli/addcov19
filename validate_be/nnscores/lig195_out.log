Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 3 (Score = 8.051 = 8.9 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 9.391 = 406.76 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
11.036 = 9.21 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
6.301 +/- 1.96 = 499.73 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

499.73 nM
