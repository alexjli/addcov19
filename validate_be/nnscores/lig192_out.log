Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 5.709 = 1.95 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
8.991 = 1.02 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
3.403 +/- 2.431 = 395.3 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

395.3 uM
