Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 5.664 = 2.17 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
8.226 = 5.94 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
5.129 +/- 1.367 = 7.42 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

7.42 uM
