Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 9.266 = 541.7 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
17.463 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
6.438 +/- 2.526 = 364.99 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

364.99 nM
