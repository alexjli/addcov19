Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 5.195 = 6.38 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
7.709 = 19.55 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
3.43 +/- 2.173 = 371.19 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

371.19 uM
