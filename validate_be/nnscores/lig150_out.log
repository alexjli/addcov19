Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 11.131 = 7.39 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
14.544 = 2.86 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
5.719 +/- 4.451 = 1.91 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.91 uM
