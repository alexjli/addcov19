Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 5.459 = 3.48 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.104 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
4.666 +/- 4.374 = 21.59 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

21.59 uM
