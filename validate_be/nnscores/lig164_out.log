Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 12.478 = 332.36 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
12.478 = 332.36 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
7.604 +/- 1.946 = 24.88 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

24.88 nM
