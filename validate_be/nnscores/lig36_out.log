Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 7.392 = 40.52 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.478 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
4.915 +/- 1.922 = 12.17 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

12.17 uM
