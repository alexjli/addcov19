Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 5.705 = 1.97 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
9.557 = 277.38 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
3.955 +/- 2.274 = 110.82 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

110.82 uM
