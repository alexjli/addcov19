Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.186 = 6.52 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
8.483 = 3.29 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.4 +/- 2.003 = 398.54 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

398.54 uM
