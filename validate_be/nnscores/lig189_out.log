Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 5.996 = 1.01 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
7.152 = 70.49 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.492 +/- 2.38 = 322.4 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

322.4 uM
