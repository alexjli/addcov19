Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.171 = 6.74 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.269 = 5.39 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.33 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
8.547 +/- 3.243 = 2.84 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.84 nM
