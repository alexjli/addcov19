Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 6.401 = 397.33 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
14.653 = 2.23 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.003 +/- 2.1 = 99.22 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

99.22 nM
