Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 3 (Score = 8.116 = 7.66 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 5.556 = 2.78 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
15.147 = 0.71 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
6.613 +/- 3.011 = 243.63 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

243.63 nM
