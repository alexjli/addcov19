Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 5.602 = 2.5 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
7.651 = 22.32 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.281 +/- 1.678 = 524.0 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

524.0 uM
