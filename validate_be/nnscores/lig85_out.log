Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 9 (Score = 8.575 = 2.66 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 8.329 = 4.69 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
15.793 = 0.16 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.376 +/- 4.609 = 42.07 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

42.07 uM
