Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 11.213 = 6.12 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
11.884 = 1.31 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
5.255 +/- 2.071 = 5.56 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

5.56 uM
