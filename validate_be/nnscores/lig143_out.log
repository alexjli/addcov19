Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 8.484 = 3.28 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
11.887 = 1.3 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.536 +/- 2.053 = 2.91 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.91 uM
