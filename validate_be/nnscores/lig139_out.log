Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 6.054 = 883.81 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
12.246 = 567.5 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
6.145 +/- 2.838 = 716.2 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

716.2 nM
