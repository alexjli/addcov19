Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 6.104 = 786.23 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
9.257 = 553.3 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
3.651 +/- 2.372 = 223.26 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

223.26 uM
