Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 5 (Score = 5.055 = 8.8 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 5.184 = 6.54 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
9.825 = 149.5 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
3.955 +/- 2.012 = 110.86 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

110.86 uM
