Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 9.403 = 394.98 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
18.405 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.459 +/- 5.717 = 34.76 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

34.76 nM
