Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.595 = 25.44 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
7.946 = 11.32 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.368 +/- 1.778 = 42.9 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

42.9 uM
