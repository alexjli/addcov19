Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 8 (Score = 8.68 = 2.09 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 10.381 = 41.6 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
14.429 = 3.72 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
6.939 +/- 2.168 = 115.09 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

115.09 nM
