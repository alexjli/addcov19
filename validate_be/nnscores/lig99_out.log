Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 7.697 = 20.11 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
17.174 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
6.19 +/- 3.17 = 645.99 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

645.99 nM
