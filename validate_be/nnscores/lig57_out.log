Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 5.676 = 2.11 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
8.197 +/- 6.15 = 6.35 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

6.35 nM
