Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 7.77 = 16.99 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
11.311 = 4.89 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.384 +/- 1.235 = 41.33 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

41.33 uM
