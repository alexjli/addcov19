Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 7.063 = 86.5 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
15.492 = 0.32 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.215 +/- 3.689 = 60.92 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

60.92 nM
