Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 8.322 = 4.77 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
12.227 = 592.65 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
5.876 +/- 2.661 = 1.33 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.33 uM
