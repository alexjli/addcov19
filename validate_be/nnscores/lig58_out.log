Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 1 (Score = 5.378 = 4.19 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 8.483 = 3.29 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
9.831 = 147.49 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.368 +/- 2.376 = 42.82 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

42.82 uM
