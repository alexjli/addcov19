Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 6.185 = 653.37 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
13.877 = 13.27 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
3.132 +/- 3.094 = 737.63 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

737.63 uM
