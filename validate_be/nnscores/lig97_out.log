Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 1 (Score = 4.337 = 46.07 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 7.341 = 45.64 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
7.341 = 45.64 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.445 +/- 2.566 = 358.86 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

358.86 uM
