Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 8.308 = 4.92 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.938 +/- 4.971 = 11.54 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

11.54 nM
