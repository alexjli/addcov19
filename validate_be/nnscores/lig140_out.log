Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 5.324 = 4.74 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
14.399 = 3.99 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.891 +/- 3.363 = 12.85 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

12.85 uM
