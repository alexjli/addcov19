Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 9.96 = 109.57 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
5.369 +/- 2.099 = 4.28 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

4.28 uM
