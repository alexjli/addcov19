Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 4 (Score = 5.469 = 3.4 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 5.718 = 1.91 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
9.0 = 1.0 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
4.954 +/- 1.504 = 11.11 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

11.11 uM
