Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 11.021 = 9.52 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
15.039 = 0.91 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
6.101 +/- 2.349 = 791.94 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

791.94 nM
