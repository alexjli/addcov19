When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
9.417 = 382.9 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
4.664 +/- 1.974 = 21.65 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

21.65 uM
