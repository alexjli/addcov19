Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 5.483 = 3.29 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
14.231 = 5.87 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
3.12 +/- 2.968 = 758.09 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

758.09 uM
