Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 7.231 = 58.76 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
12.834 = 146.72 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.863 +/- 2.598 = 13.72 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

13.72 uM
