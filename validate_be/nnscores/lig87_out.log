Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 9 (Score = 3.494 = 320.3 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 8.015 = 9.66 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
8.015 = 9.66 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
3.989 +/- 1.789 = 102.58 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

102.58 uM
