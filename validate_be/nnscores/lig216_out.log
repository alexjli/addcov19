Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.374 = 42.27 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
13.592 = 25.58 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
6.99 +/- 2.797 = 102.32 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

102.32 nM
