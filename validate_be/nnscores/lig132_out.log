Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 6.784 = 164.32 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.408 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
7.272 +/- 2.088 = 53.44 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

53.44 nM
