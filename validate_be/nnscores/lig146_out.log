Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 6.918 = 120.91 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.437 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
5.153 +/- 3.462 = 7.03 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

7.03 uM
