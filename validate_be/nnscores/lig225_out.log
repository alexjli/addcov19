Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 8.421 = 3.79 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.483 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
8.632 +/- 6.119 = 2.34 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.34 nM
