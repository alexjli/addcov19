Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 3 (Score = 3.889 = 129.1 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 8.26 = 5.5 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
13.087 = 81.91 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
3.492 +/- 2.058 = 321.78 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

321.78 uM
