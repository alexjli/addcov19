Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 7.788 = 16.29 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
12.573 = 267.53 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
6.732 +/- 2.2 = 185.36 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

185.36 nM
