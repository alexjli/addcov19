Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 5 (Score = 8.134 = 7.35 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.726 = 18.77 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
16.701 = 0.02 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
6.558 +/- 3.898 = 276.56 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

276.56 nM
