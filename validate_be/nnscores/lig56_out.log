Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 7.903 = 12.5 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
14.721 = 1.9 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
3.841 +/- 1.654 = 144.35 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

144.35 uM
