Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 10.526 = 29.81 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
16.894 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
3.905 +/- 2.381 = 124.41 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

124.41 uM
