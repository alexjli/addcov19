Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 10.433 = 36.9 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
18.162 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
6.37 +/- 1.645 = 426.39 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

426.39 nM
