Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 10.087 = 81.83 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
10.087 = 81.83 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
4.989 +/- 1.552 = 10.26 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

10.26 uM
