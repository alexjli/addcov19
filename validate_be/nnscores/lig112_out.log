Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 7.26 = 54.95 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
18.478 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.411 +/- 2.781 = 38.81 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

38.81 nM
