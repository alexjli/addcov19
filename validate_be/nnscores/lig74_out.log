Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.711 = 19.43 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
8.503 +/- 6.204 = 3.14 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

3.14 nM
