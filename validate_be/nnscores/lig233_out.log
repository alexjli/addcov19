Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 6.138 = 728.57 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
13.422 = 37.86 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
7.099 +/- 3.74 = 79.69 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

79.69 nM
