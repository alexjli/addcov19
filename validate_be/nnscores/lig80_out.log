Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 2 (Score = 8.131 = 7.39 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 5.096 = 8.02 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.325 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
6.495 +/- 5.419 = 319.78 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

319.78 nM
