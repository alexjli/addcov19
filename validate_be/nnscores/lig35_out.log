Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.275 = 53.12 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
9.757 = 174.85 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
5.019 +/- 1.451 = 9.58 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

9.58 uM
