Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 8.281 = 5.23 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
11.716 = 1.92 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
5.213 +/- 1.895 = 6.13 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

6.13 uM
