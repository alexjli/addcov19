Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.678 = 21.01 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 8.655 = 2.21 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
9.955 = 110.93 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.448 +/- 2.029 = 3.56 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

3.56 uM
