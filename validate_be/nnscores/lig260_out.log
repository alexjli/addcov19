Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 8.951 = 1.12 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.462 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
7.967 +/- 2.991 = 10.8 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

10.8 nM
