Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 9.31 = 489.63 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.299 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
3.395 +/- 1.874 = 403.17 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

403.17 uM
