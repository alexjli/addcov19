Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 7.442 = 36.15 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
17.469 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.019 +/- 4.93 = 95.73 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

95.73 nM
