Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 5.88 = 1.32 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
18.44 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
4.399 +/- 1.729 = 39.89 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

39.89 uM
