When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
12.728 = 187.1 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
5.487 +/- 2.89 = 3.26 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

3.26 uM
