When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
18.422 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
7.54 +/- 5.536 = 28.85 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

28.85 nM
