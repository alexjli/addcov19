Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 8.061 = 8.68 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
11.637 = 2.3 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
5.21 +/- 1.184 = 6.16 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

6.16 uM
