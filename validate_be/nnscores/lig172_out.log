Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.751 = 17.74 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
8.166 = 6.83 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
5.867 +/- 1.345 = 1.36 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.36 uM
