Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 8 (Score = 8.142 = 7.22 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 7.029 = 93.6 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
7.36 +/- 5.283 = 43.61 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

43.61 nM
