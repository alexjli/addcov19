Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 9.015 = 965.61 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
14.365 = 4.32 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
3.377 +/- 2.554 = 419.59 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

419.59 uM
