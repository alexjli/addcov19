Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 8 (Score = 8.744 = 1.8 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 8.858 = 1.39 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
12.919 = 120.58 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
6.255 +/- 2.456 = 555.48 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

555.48 nM
