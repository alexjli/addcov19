Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 7.474 = 33.54 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
17.793 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
7.637 +/- 2.001 = 23.06 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

23.06 nM
