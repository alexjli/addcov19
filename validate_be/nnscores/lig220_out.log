Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 6.397 = 400.92 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
16.908 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
4.867 +/- 3.939 = 13.58 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

13.58 uM
