Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 6.552 = 280.66 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
17.225 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
6.516 +/- 2.482 = 304.92 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

304.92 nM
