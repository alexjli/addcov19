When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
15.939 = 0.12 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
4.409 +/- 2.64 = 39.01 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

39.01 uM
