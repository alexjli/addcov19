Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 1 (Score = 6.034 = 924.27 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.982 = 1.04 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
8.982 = 1.04 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.545 +/- 2.379 = 28.52 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

28.52 uM
