Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.142 = 7.21 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 8.973 = 1.06 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
7.75 +/- 5.538 = 17.8 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

17.8 nM
