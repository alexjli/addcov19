Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 9.674 = 211.97 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
12.753 = 176.49 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
5.703 +/- 2.545 = 1.98 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.98 uM
