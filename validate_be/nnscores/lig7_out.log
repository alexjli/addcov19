Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 4.843 = 14.37 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.36 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
3.806 +/- 2.533 = 156.23 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

156.23 uM
