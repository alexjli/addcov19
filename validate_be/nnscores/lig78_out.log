Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 4 (Score = 8.036 = 9.19 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 7.914 = 12.2 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.202 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
7.121 +/- 2.386 = 75.69 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

75.69 nM
