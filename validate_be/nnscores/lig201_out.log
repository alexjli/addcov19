Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 12.4 = 398.15 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
18.482 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.773 +/- 3.926 = 16.87 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

16.87 nM
