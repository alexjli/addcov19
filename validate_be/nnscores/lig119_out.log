Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 6.281 = 524.08 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
17.023 = 0.01 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.104 +/- 3.671 = 78.72 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

78.72 uM
