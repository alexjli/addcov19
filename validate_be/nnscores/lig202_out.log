Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 5 (Score = 5.63 = 2.35 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 8.454 = 3.52 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
14.115 = 7.68 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
4.87 +/- 2.998 = 13.49 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

13.49 uM
