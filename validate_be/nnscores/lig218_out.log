Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 9.757 = 174.82 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
18.472 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
4.391 +/- 3.166 = 40.62 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

40.62 uM
