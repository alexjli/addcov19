Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 9.484 = 328.17 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
8.664 +/- 3.592 = 2.17 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.17 nM
