Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 7.979 = 10.5 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.482 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
7.032 +/- 5.804 = 92.98 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

92.98 nM
