Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 5.569 = 2.7 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
9.328 = 470.34 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
4.0 +/- 2.298 = 100.03 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

100.03 uM
