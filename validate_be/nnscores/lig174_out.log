Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 12.359 = 437.08 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.318 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
6.816 +/- 1.986 = 152.83 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

152.83 nM
