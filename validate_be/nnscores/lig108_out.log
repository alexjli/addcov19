Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 4.598 = 25.25 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
13.039 = 91.44 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.257 +/- 2.191 = 5.53 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

5.53 uM
