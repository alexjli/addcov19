Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 7.297 = 50.49 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.692 = 20.33 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.894 +/- 1.554 = 12.76 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

12.76 uM
