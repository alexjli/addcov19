Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 9.688 = 204.93 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
17.35 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
5.95 +/- 3.584 = 1.12 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.12 uM
