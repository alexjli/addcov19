Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 7.805 = 15.65 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
7.805 = 15.65 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
3.854 +/- 2.12 = 140.03 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

140.03 uM
