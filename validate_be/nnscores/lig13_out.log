Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 9.936 = 115.75 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
11.34 = 4.57 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.254 +/- 2.414 = 5.58 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

5.58 uM
