Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 1 (Score = 6.707 = 196.29 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 5.886 = 1.3 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
9.833 = 146.82 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.186 +/- 2.5 = 65.22 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

65.22 uM
