Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 7.357 = 43.92 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
10.385 = 41.23 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.902 +/- 2.114 = 12.52 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

12.52 uM
