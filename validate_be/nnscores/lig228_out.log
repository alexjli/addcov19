Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 9.431 = 370.31 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
9.431 = 370.31 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
5.834 +/- 1.369 = 1.46 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.46 uM
