Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 6.341 = 455.54 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
18.482 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
7.558 +/- 4.21 = 27.68 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

27.68 nM
