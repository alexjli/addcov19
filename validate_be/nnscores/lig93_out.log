Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 5 (Score = 5.007 = 9.83 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 5.591 = 2.56 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
7.379 = 41.78 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
3.527 +/- 1.947 = 297.49 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

297.49 uM
