Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 8.617 = 2.42 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
17.459 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
4.881 +/- 3.751 = 13.15 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

13.15 uM
