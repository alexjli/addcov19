Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 8.048 = 8.96 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
13.929 = 11.77 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
4.339 +/- 2.788 = 45.76 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

45.76 uM
