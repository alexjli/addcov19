Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 6.806 = 156.48 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
16.007 = 0.1 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
5.797 +/- 3.2 = 1.6 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.6 uM
