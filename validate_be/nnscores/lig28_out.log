Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 6.079 = 833.91 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
9.191 = 643.9 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
5.662 +/- 1.524 = 2.18 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.18 uM
