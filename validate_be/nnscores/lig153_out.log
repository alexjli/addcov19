Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 6.606 = 247.96 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
9.149 = 710.26 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.161 +/- 1.751 = 69.09 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

69.09 uM
