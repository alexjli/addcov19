Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.799 = 1.59 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.474 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.232 +/- 2.641 = 58.57 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

58.57 uM
