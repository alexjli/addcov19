Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 6.258 = 552.7 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
9.179 = 661.54 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
5.475 +/- 2.481 = 3.35 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

3.35 uM
