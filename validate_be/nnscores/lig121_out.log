Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 5 (Score = 8.085 = 8.23 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 7.92 = 12.03 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
13.599 = 25.2 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
6.33 +/- 3.006 = 467.91 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

467.91 nM
