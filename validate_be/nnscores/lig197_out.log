Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 9.858 = 138.8 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.437 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
8.416 +/- 5.425 = 3.84 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

3.84 nM
