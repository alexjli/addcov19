Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 3 (Score = 9.78 = 166.07 pM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.525 = 29.85 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
11.308 = 4.92 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
5.012 +/- 2.148 = 9.72 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

9.72 uM
