Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 8 (Score = 9.436 = 366.07 pM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.373 = 4.24 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.481 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.569 +/- 5.485 = 27.01 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

27.01 nM
