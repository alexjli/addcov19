Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 7.318 = 48.07 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
10.821 = 15.1 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.737 +/- 2.136 = 18.3 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

18.3 uM
