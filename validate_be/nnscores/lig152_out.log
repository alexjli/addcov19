Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 11.34 = 4.58 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
11.34 = 4.58 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
3.407 +/- 3.361 = 391.35 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

391.35 uM
