Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 9 (Score = 2.745 = 1.8 mM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.88 = 13.17 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.88 = 13.17 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.079 +/- 2.353 = 832.89 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

832.89 uM
