Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 2 (Score = 8.14 = 7.25 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 7.871 = 13.44 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
16.34 = 0.05 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
6.88 +/- 2.768 = 131.83 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

131.83 nM
