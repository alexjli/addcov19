Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 7.811 = 15.44 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
8.43 = 3.71 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
6.398 +/- 1.831 = 400.09 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

400.09 nM
