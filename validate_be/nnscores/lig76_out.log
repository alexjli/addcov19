Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 4.941 = 11.46 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
14.513 = 3.07 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
6.509 +/- 3.227 = 310.04 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

310.04 nM
