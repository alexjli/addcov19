Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 6.218 = 604.99 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
9.294 = 508.47 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
5.218 +/- 1.672 = 6.05 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

6.05 uM
