Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 9.275 = 531.41 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.483 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
7.869 +/- 6.189 = 13.54 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

13.54 nM
