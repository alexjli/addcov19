Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 9 (Score = 8.14 = 7.25 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 7.968 = 10.75 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
18.482 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.398 +/- 4.829 = 40.02 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

40.02 nM
