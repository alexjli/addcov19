Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 7.164 = 68.5 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
13.921 = 12.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
7.653 +/- 2.666 = 22.23 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

22.23 nM
