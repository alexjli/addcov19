Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 7.53 = 29.52 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
9.367 = 429.07 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.074 +/- 2.251 = 84.36 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

84.36 uM
