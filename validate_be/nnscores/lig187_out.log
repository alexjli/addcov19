Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 2 (Score = 8.46 = 3.47 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 8.066 = 8.59 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
13.224 = 59.7 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
4.406 +/- 2.586 = 39.27 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

39.27 uM
