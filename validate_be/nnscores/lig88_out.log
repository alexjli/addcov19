Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 12.602 = 249.94 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.481 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
8.821 +/- 5.056 = 1.51 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.51 nM
