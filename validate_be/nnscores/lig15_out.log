Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 4.945 = 11.35 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
15.135 = 0.73 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.547 +/- 2.112 = 28.41 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

28.41 uM
