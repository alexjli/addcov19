Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 11.249 = 5.64 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
12.496 = 319.12 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
4.778 +/- 2.22 = 16.66 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

16.66 uM
