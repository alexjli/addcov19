Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 11.3 = 5.01 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
15.768 = 0.17 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
7.79 +/- 2.978 = 16.21 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

16.21 nM
