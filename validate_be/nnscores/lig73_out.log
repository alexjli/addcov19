Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 6.686 = 206.05 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
8.766 = 1.71 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
4.716 +/- 1.808 = 19.22 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

19.22 uM
