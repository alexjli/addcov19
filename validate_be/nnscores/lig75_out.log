Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 8.753 = 1.77 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
8.753 = 1.77 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
3.59 +/- 2.0 = 256.84 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

256.84 uM
