Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 4.735 = 18.39 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
8.292 = 5.1 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
3.7 +/- 1.969 = 199.74 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

199.74 uM
