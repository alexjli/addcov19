Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 7.348 = 44.87 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
17.516 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
5.377 +/- 1.764 = 4.2 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

4.2 uM
