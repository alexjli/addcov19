Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 10.663 = 21.72 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.288 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
7.56 +/- 4.899 = 27.54 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

27.54 nM
