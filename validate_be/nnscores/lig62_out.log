Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 2 (Score = 2.468 = 3.4 mM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 5.056 = 8.79 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
9.117 = 764.46 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.242 +/- 2.624 = 572.23 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

572.23 uM
