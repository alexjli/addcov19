Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 6.835 = 146.34 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
14.834 = 1.46 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
6.379 +/- 1.916 = 417.92 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

417.92 nM
