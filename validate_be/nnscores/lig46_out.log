When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
17.539 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
5.844 +/- 4.196 = 1.43 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.43 uM
