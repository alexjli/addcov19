Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 9.487 = 326.15 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.509 +/- 5.463 = 30.94 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

30.94 nM
