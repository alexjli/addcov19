Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 4.911 = 12.26 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
7.34 = 45.67 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
4.011 +/- 1.993 = 97.4 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

97.4 uM
