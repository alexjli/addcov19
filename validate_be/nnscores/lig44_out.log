Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 8 (Score = 7.488 = 32.51 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 8 (Score = 8.823 = 1.5 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
15.385 = 0.41 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
7.573 +/- 2.141 = 26.73 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

26.73 nM
