Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 5 (Score = 6.618 = 241.26 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
7.447 = 35.71 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.822 +/- 1.148 = 15.06 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

15.06 uM
