Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 8.13 = 7.42 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 4 (Score =
18.48 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
5.641 +/- 3.799 = 2.29 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.29 uM
