Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 8.985 = 1.04 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
8.985 = 1.04 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
4.135 +/- 2.316 = 73.36 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

73.36 uM
