Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 7.143 = 71.9 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
16.021 = 0.1 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
5.368 +/- 3.203 = 4.28 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

4.28 uM
