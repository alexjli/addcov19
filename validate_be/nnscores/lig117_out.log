Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 5 (Score = 7.903 = 12.52 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 6 (Score = 9.604 = 248.8 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
9.604 = 248.8 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 6 (Score =
4.245 +/- 2.097 = 56.83 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

56.83 uM
