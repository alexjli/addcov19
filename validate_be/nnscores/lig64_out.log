Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.315 = 48.43 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
18.482 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
7.569 +/- 3.712 = 26.98 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

26.98 nM
