Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.036 = 92.05 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
7.466 = 34.19 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
4.837 +/- 2.426 = 14.56 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

14.56 uM
