Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 13.15 = 70.82 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
18.484 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
8.216 +/- 7.368 = 6.08 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

6.08 nM
