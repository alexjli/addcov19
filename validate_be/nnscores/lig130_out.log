Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 4 (Score = 7.6 = 25.12 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 6.897 = 126.88 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
8.125 = 7.5 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 9 (Score =
3.397 +/- 1.859 = 400.44 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

400.44 uM
