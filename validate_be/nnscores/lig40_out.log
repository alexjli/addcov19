Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 7 (Score = 2.965 = 1.08 mM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 4 (Score = 5.125 = 7.5 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
6.263 = 545.75 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
2.656 +/- 1.6 = 2.21 mM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

2.21 mM
