Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 7.62 = 23.97 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
9.668 = 214.92 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
3.992 +/- 2.123 = 101.9 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

101.9 uM
