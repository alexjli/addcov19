Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 3 (Score = 5.273 = 5.34 uM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 1 (Score = 7.987 = 10.3 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
14.69 = 2.04 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.466 +/- 3.417 = 34.19 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

34.19 uM
