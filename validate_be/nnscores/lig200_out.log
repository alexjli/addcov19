Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 7.667 = 21.55 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
18.032 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
7.939 +/- 3.602 = 11.52 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

11.52 nM
