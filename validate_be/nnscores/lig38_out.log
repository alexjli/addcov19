When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
18.444 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
7.687 +/- 4.441 = 20.56 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

20.56 nM
