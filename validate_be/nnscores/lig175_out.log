Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 9 (Score = 6.484 = 328.16 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
9.387 = 410.51 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 8 (Score =
4.274 +/- 1.918 = 53.23 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

53.23 uM
