Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 5.166 = 6.82 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
9.78 = 166.06 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 3 (Score =
3.437 +/- 1.629 = 365.79 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

365.79 uM
