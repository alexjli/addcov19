Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 7 (Score = 8.294 = 5.08 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
14.761 = 1.74 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 7 (Score =
5.292 +/- 2.917 = 5.1 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.
