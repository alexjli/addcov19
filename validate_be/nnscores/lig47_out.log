Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 3 (Score = 6.079 = 833.11 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 5 (Score =
7.423 = 37.79 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
3.543 +/- 1.777 = 286.34 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

286.34 uM
