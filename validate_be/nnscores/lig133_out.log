Best pose scored by network #19: MODEL 2 (Score = 8.121 = 7.57 nM)
Best pose scored by network #20: MODEL 2 (Score = 5.719 = 1.91 uM)

When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
8.121 = 7.57 nM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 2 (Score =
4.183 +/- 2.074 = 65.64 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

65.64 uM
