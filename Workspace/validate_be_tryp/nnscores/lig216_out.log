When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
9.081 = 830.72 pM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
5.798 +/- 2.503 = 1.59 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.59 uM
