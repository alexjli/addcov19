When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
18.221 = 0.0 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
8.979 +/- 3.988 = 1.05 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

1.05 nM
