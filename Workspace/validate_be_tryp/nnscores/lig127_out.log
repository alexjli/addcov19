When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
15.865 = 0.14 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
4.278 +/- 3.698 = 52.73 uM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

52.73 uM
