When the poses were ranked by the best of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
16.204 = 0.06 fM)

When the poses were ranked by the average of the 20 network scores
associated with each pose, the best-scoring pose was MODEL 1 (Score =
8.385 +/- 3.528 = 4.13 nM). This is the recommended ranking/scoring
metric.

4.13 nM
